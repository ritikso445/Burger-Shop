# Burger-Shop
Our Burger Shop Website is an interactive and user-friendly platform designed to showcase a variety of delicious burgers online. This project was developed as part of our college assignment to demonstrate our skills in front-end and back-end web development using modern technologies. The website aims to replicate a real-world burger shop experience in a digital environment, allowing users to browse the menu, view detailed descriptions of burgers, and place their orders seamlessly.

The website features an attractive and responsive user interface, ensuring smooth functionality across all devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. The front-end of the website was developed by me using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It includes visually appealing layouts, engaging color themes, and interactive components like a dynamic burger menu, add-to-cart feature, and order summary page. Animations and transitions were implemented to enhance user engagement and make the browsing experience enjoyable.

The back-end development was handled by my teammate, Karan Singh Bhati, using Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL. This part of the system manages all core functionalities, such as handling user data, storing order details securely, and managing the burger inventory in the database. We also integrated CRUD operations for adding, updating, and deleting items from the menu, ensuring the system remains scalable and easy to maintain.

For added security and better performance, the backend includes authentication features for user login and admin panel access. This ensures only authorized users can manage the menu and check orders. The database, built with MySQL, efficiently stores information related to burgers, users, and orders, allowing quick retrieval and updates.

In addition to functionality, we focused on creating a realistic e-commerce feel. Users can browse through different categories of burgers, view prices, and select multiple items before checkout. The goal was to make the site as close to a real burger shop as possible, both visually and functionally.

This project helped us strengthen our knowledge of full-stack development, teamwork, and real-world problem-solving. It also gave us hands-on experience in connecting the front-end UI with a secure and optimized back-end, creating a complete web application.
